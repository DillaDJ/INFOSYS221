Like the group project, this assignment had some easy sections and some hard sections. 
I think 3.1 and 3.4 were easy because of my background, I think I went into too much detail in 3.2 for psuedocode so that was relatively challenging...
Coming up with a problem in 3.3 was difficult as I scrapped a good number of them.

The time taken to do this assignment was a little bit longer than I'd hoped it would be but it wasn't by that much.
I think I need to know more about how detailed I need to make my psuedocode, I think I pretty much just wrote code in 3.2 so I should probably work on that.
I already have a good understanding of algorithms and all of the actual contents of code but working on problem solving and psuedocode is what I think I should do.
